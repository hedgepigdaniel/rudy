### BREAKING CHANGES

* **$promises:** now on both the client and server you have to do dispatch(firstRoute()) to kick
things off, no more thunk(store); also no more initialDispatch option; thunks and their returns are
returned from all route actions, which may be a promise (all route actions can therefore be
awaited); also all "bag" arguments to our callbacks now nest the "extra" argument (you're supposed
to provide it as an object of key/vals you want in the 3rd arg to prevent unnecessary nesting); all
dispatches to other routes during our callbacks are treated as redirects (you no longer have to wrap
them in a call to our redirect action creator).
* **$from/toPath:** path segments that are numbers will now be passed to to/fromPath
